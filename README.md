# Random-Helpful-Things
## About
A place to keep all of the things that I have found very helpful, mostly to do with GNU/Linux

## Goal
I would like to make a searchable database of examples for things like line-editors, shell script and GNU/Linux anything.
I would like to turn the wiki here into a man page and a Helper scripts (might write them in C) that let you search and add items.


## Format
In the works...
So far the helpers.txt file has one space between hints. every hint has a title line starting with two `#` containg the name of the program, explination and tag words for the search.

## Info
I will atempt to keep larger things in the [Wiki on Github](https://github.com/djorborn/Random-Helpful-Things/wiki).

I have a simple Shell script to add commnds to a searchable file `helpers.txt`

I will atempt to add these commands to the Wiki with more information when I find the time.

## Help Welcome
If you feel like you have helpful hints that seem to fit, feel free to make a pull request.
